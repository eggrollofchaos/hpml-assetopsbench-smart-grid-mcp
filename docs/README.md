# Documentation Index

Living, authored documentation for the SmartGridBench project. Everything in this directory is a doc that **evolves** with the project - domain background, setup guides, architecture notes, methodology. Historical planning records live in [../planning/archive/](../planning/archive/); current task truth lives in GitHub Issues / Projects and active docs. Frozen deliverables (shipped PDFs, slide decks) live in [../reports/](../reports/). Historical supporting notes that are no longer live move into [archive/](archive/). Lower-churn class / mentor / setup references now live under [knowledge-base/reference/](knowledge-base/reference/).

| [execution_plan.md](execution_plan.md) | Task dependency map (Tier 1-5 critical path) + benchmarking operations (async batch workflow, 5-cell experimental grid, role clarifications) | You want to know what blocks what, who owns what, and what running experiments actually looks like operationally |
| [runbook.md](runbook.md) | Canonical end-to-end reproducibility runbook for the infra side — preconditions, first-time setup, submitting benchmark cells, profiling workflow, troubleshooting decision tree, pointers to detailed runbooks | You need to stand up the serving / benchmark / profiling pipeline from scratch without verbal help |
| [infra_profiling_serving_brief.md](infra_profiling_serving_brief.md) | One-page paper-bound fact pack for `#43`: model IDs + version pins + Slurm run shape + profiling instrumentation + WandB linkage + canonical run IDs + GCP A100 path + known limitations. Verbatim-quotable bullets, no narrative | You're filling §3 System Design or the §infra paragraphs of `#39` / `#40` and need concrete cite-by-job-id facts without rereading every detailed runbook |
| [validation_log.md](validation_log.md) | Canonical log of concrete serve / benchmark / profiling proofs, including run IDs, artifacts, what each run actually proved, and caveats | You need the durable record of live validation runs rather than the how-to runbooks |
| [compute_plan.md](archive/compute_plan.md) | Phase-by-phase GPU allocation across Insomnia (H100, A6000) and $500/person GCP budget, hardware strategy decisions | You need to spin up an environment or pick a GPU for a workload |
| [gcp_fallback.md](gcp_fallback.md) | Emergency GCP A100 spin-up runbook — when to use it, instance selection, env setup, artifact persistence, shutdown, spot preemption handling, budget tracking, known GPU differences from Insomnia | Insomnia is down / queue-saturated and you need GPUs now, or you're considering a one-off A100 run |
| [insomnia_runbook.md](insomnia_runbook.md) | Verified Insomnia setup notes - Slurm account/partition/QoS, scratch storage, CUDA/cuDNN workarounds, vLLM Python-version gotcha, login-node etiquette, queue tips, foreground-debug recipe | You're hitting weird Slurm/CUDA/vLLM behavior on Insomnia and need verified working settings |
| [governance/model_registry.yaml](governance/model_registry.yaml) | Canonical registry for the current local-vLLM and WatsonX model contracts, including served model names, repo-facing model IDs, runtime pins, and the standardized `MODEL_REVISION` for the local Llama mirror | You need the quick source of truth for which model names/IDs/runtime pins the repo is actually supposed to use |
| [slurm_cheatsheet.md](slurm_cheatsheet.md) | Command-first Slurm reference for submit, watch, estimate start, inspect failures, and historical timing on Insomnia | You need the exact command for `sbatch`, `srun`, `squeue`, `sacct`, `scontrol`, or `scancel` without rereading the longer runbook |
| [orchestration_wiring.md](orchestration_wiring.md) | Current repo-side orchestration status for Plan-Execute, Agent-as-Tool, and Hybrid, including what is genuinely wired now versus only adapter-ready | You need to know what `#22` / `#62` cover in this repo and what is still upstream or mentor-gated |
| [experiment_matrix.md](experiment_matrix.md) | Sharp statement of the core experiment grid, trial policy, Self-Ask tracking, and which optional follow-on cells are worth adding later | You want one defensible answer to "what exactly are we running?" before the matrix sprawls |

| [lane2_int8_kv_status.md](archive/lane2_int8_kv_status.md) | Lane 2 status for `#29` (INT8) and `#30` (KV-cache) — vLLM 0.19.0 quantization landscape, INT8 deferral rationale + smoke evidence (`8979660`), chosen KV-cache knob (prefix caching only — fp8 KV tested in smoke `8979532` and deferred due to a vLLM 0.19.0 FA3 kernel constraint under FP16 weights), and recorded Insomnia smoke results | You need to know what optimizations Cell C bundles, why INT8 is deferred, or how to read the Lane 2 smoke evidence |
| [failure_analysis_scaffold.md](failure_analysis_scaffold.md) | Before/after metric pack for `#36`: outcome / failure-shape / latency / profiling field list, comparison ledger, export contract, comparison-ready status labels | You need the canonical contract for what the `#36` rerun lane has to produce so notebook and paper exports stay joinable |
| [failure_taxonomy_evidence.md](failure_taxonomy_evidence.md) | Failure taxonomy classification for `#35`: Berkeley categories, decision ladder, evidence schema, populated Apr 22 evidence pass, paper-safe wording guide, classification workflow | You need to label observed failures with concrete artifact backing instead of vibes, and you want one evidence row per `(run_name, scenario_id, trial_index)` |
| [failure_visuals_mitigation.md](failure_visuals_mitigation.md) | Visuals scaffold + figure-ready aggregation contract + mitigation ranking rubric + Apr 22 mitigation ranking + promotion gate into `#65` / `#66` for `#64` | You need to decide which mitigation goes first into implementation/rerun and what figure each visual should render from |
| [mitigation_recovery_adjudication.md](mitigation_recovery_adjudication.md) | Implementation-ready spec for the retry/replan recovery and explicit fault/risk adjudication mitigation rungs | You need to implement or review the follow-on mitigation ladder without creating a full cell-by-mitigation grid |

| [neurips_submission_packet.md](neurips_submission_packet.md) | Deadline-facing NeurIPS control packet for `#5` / `#39` / `#47` / `#48`: submission surface, exact abstract candidate, claim tiers, current result snapshot, figure queue, and blockers | You need the shortest source of truth for what can be submitted now and what still blocks the full paper |
| [neurips_overleaf_transfer_plan.md](neurips_overleaf_transfer_plan.md) | Repo-to-Overleaf sync plan for the NeurIPS 2026 project: what was copied, what remains caveated, and which metric sources back paper tables and figures | You need to keep Overleaf aligned with repo evidence without re-deriving the copy order |
| [final_report_backport_scaffold.md](final_report_backport_scaffold.md) | Class final report back-port scaffold for `#40`: IEEE section map, drift-control rules, figure/table requirements, and conversion checklist from the NeurIPS draft | You need to turn the NeurIPS draft into the class final report without inventing a second source of truth |
| [final_presentation_deck.md](final_presentation_deck.md) | Slide-by-slide final presentation draft for `#44`: deck spine, claims, proof objects, result tables, and backup Q&A prompts | You need to convert the current paper/report story into the class presentation deck |

## Conventions

- **One purpose per file** - if a doc is doing two things, split it.
- **Date-stamped markdown updates** - every doc should have a `*Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD*` line near the top. Stale dates are a smell.
- **Cross-reference other docs by relative path** - e.g. [compute plan](archive/compute_plan.md), not absolute URLs. Keeps the repo portable.
- **Low-churn reference docs live under `knowledge-base/reference/`** - class requirements, mentor guidance, and setup references that change less often should live there rather than crowding the top-level index.
- **Paper-ready content (LaTeX) lives here** - finished paper sections can be dropped into Overleaf as `.tex` files. Don't mix draft and final in the same file; use git history for versions.
- **No shipped deliverables here** - if it's a frozen PDF/PPTX/Keynote export that was submitted or emailed, it belongs in `../reports/`, not `docs/`.
- **No active planning artifacts here** - historical planning records live in
  `../planning/archive/`; agent-coordination surfaces are no longer part of this
  team repo's documentation tree.
