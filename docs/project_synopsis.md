# Project Synopsis -- Cold Start Guide

*Last updated April 18, 2026. Read time: ~10 minutes.*

## What is this project?

A 4-person team at Columbia University is building a performance benchmarking study for
an AI agent system applied to industrial equipment maintenance. The project sits at the
intersection of LLM-based AI agents, industrial operations, and high-performance ML
systems.

## The class

**COMS E6998: High Performance Machine Learning** (HPML), taught by Prof. Kaoutar El
Maghraoui at Columbia. The class focuses on optimizing ML workloads -- profiling where
time is spent (data loading, preprocessing, inference), applying optimization techniques
(quantization, caching, batching), and measuring the impact on GPU-accelerated
infrastructure. Every project must demonstrate measurable before/after performance
improvements using tools like PyTorch Profiler, NVIDIA Nsight, and Weights & Biases.

## The mentor and IBM connection

Our project is mentored by **Dr. Dhaval Patel** from IBM Research. IBM built an open-source
benchmark called **AssetOpsBench** that tests how well AI agents can handle industrial
maintenance tasks. Dhaval proposed four project ideas for HPML teams; we were assigned a
combination of two of them.

## Background: What is AssetOpsBench?

AssetOpsBench is a benchmark for evaluating AI agents on industrial asset operations and
maintenance (O&M). Think: a factory has hundreds of machines (turbines, chillers,
transformers). When something goes wrong -- a sensor spikes, a part degrades, a failure
mode appears -- an AI agent needs to:

1. **Read sensor data** (IoT telemetry -- temperature, vibration, gas levels)
2. **Diagnose the problem** (map symptoms to known failure modes using FMSR -- Failure
   Mode to Sensor Relation databases)
3. **Forecast** what will happen next (time-series forecasting with TSFM models)
4. **Create a work order** (WO -- assign a technician, set priority, schedule repair)

AssetOpsBench has four "tool domains" that correspond to these steps:

| Domain | What it does | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **IoT** | Sensor telemetry and asset metadata | "Get temperature readings for Chiller #4 over the last 24 hours" |
| **FMSR** | Maps failure modes to sensor patterns | "What failure mode correlates with high H2 and low C2H6?" |
| **TSFM** | Time-series forecasting and anomaly detection | "Predict remaining useful life for this transformer" |
| **WO** | Work order management | "Create a priority-1 work order for a high-voltage technician" |

An AI agent (powered by an LLM like Llama-3 or GPT-4) is given a maintenance scenario
and must use these tools to resolve it. The benchmark measures whether the agent picks
the right tools, calls them correctly, and reaches the right conclusion.

AssetOpsBench currently has 467 scenarios across 6 HuggingFace subsets on
[HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ibm-research/AssetOpsBench) (chillers, AHUs,
compressors, hydraulic pumps, bearings, boilers). Our job is to add a 7th: Smart Grid
power transformers.

## Background: What is MCP?

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open protocol (created by Anthropic) that
standardizes how LLMs interact with external tools. Instead of each LLM having its own
bespoke tool-calling format, MCP provides a universal JSON-RPC interface: the LLM sends
a structured request to an "MCP server," which executes the tool and returns results.

Think of it like a USB standard for AI tools -- any LLM that speaks MCP can use any MCP
server, regardless of who built either one.

For our project, this means wrapping all four AssetOpsBench tool domains (IoT, TSFM,
FMSR, WO) as MCP servers so that any LLM can call them through a standardized interface.
This adds a communication layer (JSON-RPC serialization/deserialization) that has
performance implications -- which is exactly what HPML wants us to measure and optimize.

## Background: What are Smart Grid transformers?

Power transformers are critical infrastructure in electrical grids. They step voltage
up/down for transmission and distribution. When a transformer fails, it can cause
blackouts and costs millions.

Transformer health is monitored through:
- **Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA)**: Gases like H2, CH4, C2H2, C2H4 dissolve in
  transformer oil. Different gas ratios indicate different failure modes (partial
  discharge, overheating, arcing).
- **Winding temperature**: Overheating degrades insulation.
- **Load profiles**: How much power the transformer carries over time.

This is a natural fit for AssetOpsBench: the sensor data maps to IoT, the gas-to-fault
mapping maps to FMSR, predicting remaining useful life maps to TSFM, and scheduling
maintenance maps to WO.

## What we're actually doing

### Problem Statement

We extend AssetOpsBench by:
1. **Creating 30+ maintenance scenarios** for Smart Grid transformers using publicly
   available Kaggle telemetry data (DGA, temperature, load, fault records)
2. **Wrapping four AssetOpsBench tool domains** (IoT, TSFM, FMSR, WO) as MCP servers
3. **Profiling the LLM agent inference pipeline** end-to-end when executing scenarios
   through MCP
4. **Comparing two orchestration paradigms** -- Agent-as-Tool and Plan-Execute -- on
   end-to-end multi-domain scenarios. Per Dhaval's lecture: Agent-as-Tool wins benchmarks
   (reflection gives self-correction) but Plan-Execute remains the preferred structured
   enterprise baseline in practice (predictable resources, visibility, no infinite loops).
   IBM-facing workflow guidance also points toward plan-first orchestration for those
   cases. A third orchestration remains optional follow-on scope; if we revive it, the
   strongest candidate is a verifier-gated Plan-Execute design rather than a generic
   reflection-checkpoint variant.

We use **Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct** served via **vLLM** on GPU infrastructure, profile with **PyTorch
Profiler**, and apply 2-3 optimization techniques:
- INT8 quantization (reduce model size and inference latency)
- KV-cache tuning (optimize memory for multi-turn tool-calling conversations)
- Batched tool-call scheduling (reduce round-trip overhead)

We also compare MCP-mediated tool calling against the existing direct function call
approach (AssetOpsBench's current ReAct-based implementation) to quantify the actual
cost of the standardization layer. This addresses a live industry debate about whether
MCP's interoperability benefits justify its overhead for simple tool-calling patterns.

We report before/after comparisons with full **WandB** experiment tracking.

### Why this problem statement works

Our mentor explicitly told us to keep scope realistic. This problem statement is
concrete and measurable -- every claim can be verified (count the scenarios, measure the
latency, compare before/after). It satisfies both the mentor's interest in extending
AssetOpsBench to new asset classes AND the class requirement for rigorous performance
profiling and optimization.

Landed on canonical history during Week 2:
- Successful Insomnia A6000 vLLM serve smoke test for Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, with kept smoke-test logs and corrected serve/test scripts
- First real WandB run is live and back-linked to committed benchmark artifacts
- Plan-Execute is wired to the team’s Smart Grid MCP servers as a real experiment condition, with one successful WatsonX-hosted 70B / Mac benchmark-facing smoke run committed under `benchmarks/cell_Y_plan_execute/`
- Scenario realism validation note landed with IEEE / IEC grounded findings and narrowed mentor questions
- Canonical harness proof / judge / first Smart Grid trajectory / judge audit-log ladder landed via `#113` and `#114`
- Self-hosted Llama-3.1-8B benchmark-path validation and MCP hardening / tests landed via `#115`
- Repo-local Verified PE and PE + Self-Ask runners landed via `#119`, with clean smoke-proof snapshots committed on canonical history
- Notebook 02 / Notebook 03 consumer scaffolds landed via `#120`

Still open from the original W2 critical path / backlog:
- final post-merge Insomnia reconciliation / proof closeout (`#111`)
- Experiment 1 Cell A runner and the first real A/B/C captures (`#25`)
- Experiment 1 / Experiment 2 execution artifacts that make Notebook 02 / Notebook 03 real rather than just scaffolded (`#26` / `#86` for NB02 Cell A/B + Cell C analysis, `#32` for NB03)
- Problem Statement B generation / validation chain (`#50 -> #2 -> #51`)

Current W3 focus:
- Experiment 1 execution: Cell A runner plus the first real A/B/C captures
- Experiment 2 execution: comparable Cell B / Y / Z artifacts
- Problem Statement B kickoff: Knowledge Plugin, first generation prototype, and evaluation methodology
- NeurIPS abstract outline / title candidates
- final runbook reconciliation + proof closeout for `#111`

Resolved during the Apr 16 post-call audit:
- `#13` closed as a resolved WO architecture decision
- `#28` closed against the first real shared WandB run
- Hybrid explicitly moved out of the active class-project critical path
- the primary local benchmark model is now clearly Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, with 70B reserved for selective scaling spot-checks only

New local follow-on work now merged:
- `#23` is now a shipped Verified PE / `Plan-Execute-Verify-Replan` runner on canonical history
- `#24` is now a shipped Self-Ask clarification hook for the active repo-local orchestration modes

Committed W3-W5 workstreams:
- Experiment 1: MCP overhead and optimization (Direct vs MCP-baseline vs MCP-optimized)
- Experiment 2: orchestration comparison and failure analysis
- Problem Statement B extension: generation pipeline, Knowledge Plugin, and validation methodology
- Paper flow: NeurIPS draft first, then class-report back-port

Current scope default:
- the working experiment grid is **vanilla Agent-as-Tool vs vanilla Plan-Execute**
- Verified PE and PE + Self-Ask are now merged local follow-on implementations, but they are still optional relative to the honest core AaT vs PE comparison
- local benchmark runs default to self-hosted Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct on Insomnia
- WatsonX-hosted 70B is used only for selective comparison runs, not as a duplicated full-grid requirement

**Final deadline: May 4** (presentation + report + code)
