## 1. Problem Statement

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/power-transformer-substation.jpg" alt="Power transformer substation" width="600">
</p>

This project extends IBM's [AssetOpsBench](https://github.com/IBM/AssetOpsBench) industrial
AI agent benchmark (467 scenarios across 6 HuggingFace subsets) by adding a 7th domain -- Smart
Grid power transformers:

1. Creating 36 paper-grade validated maintenance scenarios for **Smart Grid transformers** using public-safe synthetic telemetry data (the canonical corpus used for NeurIPS and CourseWorks claims; 25 additional scenarios added post-submission via PR #199 are present in `data/scenarios/` but excluded from paper claims)
2. Wrapping four AssetOpsBench tool domains (IoT, TSFM, FMSR, WO) as **MCP servers**
3. Profiling and optimizing the **LLM agent inference pipeline** when operating through MCP
4. Comparing two **orchestration paradigms** (Agent-as-Tool vs Plan-Execute) on end-to-end multi-domain scenarios

## 2. Model/Application Description

We serve Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct via vLLM, profile end-to-end with PyTorch Profiler, apply 2-3
optimization techniques (INT8 quantization, KV-cache tuning, batched tool-call scheduling),
and compare MCP-mediated tool calling against direct function calls to quantify protocol
overhead. All experiments tracked with WandB.

| Component | Project implementation |
|---|---|
| Base model | Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct served through vLLM; selected WatsonX Llama-3.3-70B spot checks |
| Application | Industrial smart-grid maintenance benchmark extension for AssetOpsBench |
| Tool interface | Four Smart Grid MCP servers: IoT, TSFM, FMSR, and work orders |
| Orchestration variants | Agent-as-Tool, Plan-Execute, Verified PE, and Self-Ask follow-ons |
| Profiling stack | PyTorch Profiler, `nvidia-smi` telemetry, W&B run metadata, and committed result tables |

### Datasets

| Dataset | Rows | Primary Agent | License | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Power Transformers FDD & RUL](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yuriykatser/power-transformers-fdd-and-rul) | 3,000 files x 420 | TSFM, IoT | CC0 | Kaggle |
| [DGA Fault Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bantipatel20/dissolved-gas-analysis-of-transformer) | 201 | FMSR | CC0 | Kaggle |
| [Transformer Health Index](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/easonlai/sample-power-transformers-health-condition-dataset) | 470 | FMSR | ODbL | Kaggle |
| [Current & Voltage Monitoring](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sreshta140/ai-transformer-monitoring) | 19,352 | IoT, TSFM | © Authors | Kaggle |
| [Smart Grid Fault Records](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ziya07/power-system-faults-dataset) | 506 | WO | CC0 | Kaggle |

The repo's tracked `data/processed/` artifacts are kept synthetic/public-safe. Restricted-source Kaggle joins remain a local benchmarking path, not a tracked publication path.

### Why Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct?

| Model | Params | FP16 VRAM | Tool-calling support | Fit for this project |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct** | 8B | ~16GB | Good, well-documented, strong vLLM support | Best -- fits A6000, enables rapid iteration, INT8 optimization is meaningful (16→8GB) |
| Phi-4-14B | 14B | ~28GB | Strong reasoning, less proven for tool calling | Reasonable but less community tooling |
| Mistral-Small-24B | 24B | ~48GB | Good | Needs A100, fewer experiment iterations per dollar |
| Gemma-3-27B | 27B | ~54GB | Good | Needs A100 80GB, overkill for benchmarking |

We select Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct for its favorable profiling characteristics: it fits comfortably on
an A6000 with room for KV-cache experiments, and INT8 quantization produces a meaningful
memory reduction. We optionally compare against Llama-3.3-70B (AssetOpsBench's default model)
via WatsonX API to assess scaling effects.

## 3. Final Results Summary

The final package is anchored by the submitted report, slide deck, W&B dashboard, and committed
metrics under `results/metrics/`.

| Result area | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Scenario corpus | Current repo contains 61 SmartGridBench scenario files plus 5 negative validation fixtures; the final paper/result claims preserve the paper-grade frozen scope described in the result tables and report. |
| MCP transport benchmark | First-capture AaT runs show direct, MCP baseline, and optimized MCP paths in [`results/metrics/notebook02_latency_summary.csv`](results/metrics/notebook02_latency_summary.csv). |
| Orchestration comparison | Verified PE + Self-Ask was the strongest first-capture PE-family row in the notebook export: 5/6 judge pass rate and 0.833 mean judge score in [`results/metrics/notebook03_self_ask_ablation.csv`](results/metrics/notebook03_self_ask_ablation.csv). |
| Full judged floor | The post-PR175 31-scenario aggregate is summarized in [`results/metrics/gcp_post175_core31_summary.csv`](results/metrics/gcp_post175_core31_summary.csv). |
| Profiling evidence | W&B-linked and profiler-linked run inventory is in [`results/metrics/profiling_inventory.csv`](results/metrics/profiling_inventory.csv). |

## 5. Reproducibility Instructions

### A. Environment Setup

#### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Docker (for CouchDB)
- CUDA-capable GPU (16GB+ VRAM recommended)
- Access to Columbia Insomnia cluster or Google Cloud GPU instance
- WatsonX API key (via [Codabench](https://www.codabench.org/competitions/10206/))

#### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HPML6998-S26-Team13/hpml-assetopsbench-smart-grid-mcp.git
cd hpml-assetopsbench-smart-grid-mcp
uv venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Optional overlays:

```bash
# interactive notebook authoring
uv pip install -r requirements-notebooks.txt

# Insomnia / cluster serving stack
uv pip install -r requirements-insomnia.txt
```

`requirements.txt` now also includes the portable AssetOpsBench PE-client
dependencies (`litellm` and `mcp[cli]`) needed by the repo-local Self-Ask PE /
Verified PE runners. The cluster overlay in `requirements-insomnia.txt` layers
vLLM and CUDA-specific pins on top of that base.

### B. Experiment Tracking Dashboard

- W&B dashboard (final evidence): https://wandb.ai/assetopsbench-smartgrid/assetopsbench-smartgrid/reports/SmartGridBench-Final-Evidence-Dashboard--VmlldzoxNjgyODI4NA==
- W&B project (all runs): https://wandb.ai/assetopsbench-smartgrid/assetopsbench-smartgrid

### C. Dataset

The repo tracks public-safe synthetic processed data under `data/processed/` and
AssetOpsBench-format Smart Grid scenarios under `data/scenarios/`. Raw Kaggle
downloads remain gitignored under `data/raw/` and are not required to inspect
the submitted results.

```bash
python data/generate_synthetic.py
```

### D. Training

This project benchmarks inference and tool orchestration; it does not fine-tune
the base Llama model. The model-serving path is configured through `vLLM`,
WatsonX-compatible LiteLLM endpoints, and the `configs/*.env` experiment files.

### E. Evaluation

Judge outputs and summarized metrics are committed under `results/`. To score a
new completed run directory, use the judge helper with the run directory and
matching output path:

```bash
python scripts/judge_trajectory.py \
  --run-dir benchmarks/cell_B_mcp_baseline/raw/<run-id> \
  --scenario-dir data/scenarios \
  --out results/metrics/scenario_scores.jsonl \
  --log-dir results/judge_logs
```

### F. Profiling

Profiling is enabled through the runner environment and summarized in
`results/metrics/profiling_inventory.csv`.

```bash
ENABLE_WANDB=1 TORCH_PROFILE=1 bash scripts/run_experiment.sh configs/example_baseline.env
python scripts/build_profiling_inventory.py
```

### G. Quickstart: Reproduce the Baseline Runner Path

For the currently proven benchmark-facing path:

```bash
bash scripts/run_experiment.sh configs/example_baseline.env
```

See:
- [docs/orchestration_wiring.md](docs/orchestration_wiring.md) for what is
  wired today versus only adapter-ready
- [benchmarks/cell_Y_plan_execute/](benchmarks/cell_Y_plan_execute/) for the
  first kept WatsonX smoke proof run and artifact layout
- [docs/insomnia_runbook.md](docs/insomnia_runbook.md) for the shared Insomnia
  self-hosted vLLM path

## 6. Results and Observations

- The AaT direct, MCP baseline, and optimized MCP latency comparison is
  exported in `results/metrics/notebook02_latency_summary.csv`.
- The first-capture orchestration and Self-Ask comparison is exported in
  `results/metrics/notebook03_self_ask_ablation.csv`.
- The final submitted claim set is backed by committed result tables, W&B run
  links, benchmark artifacts, and exported report/deck deliverables.

### Historical Status Snapshot

*Last updated: Apr 18, 2026 - Apr 16 post-call audit resolved the WO architecture decision, closed the first-WandB-run milestone, and narrowed the active risk to overdue W2 closeout plus W3 profiling / PS B execution.*

**Week 1 (complete):**
- [x] Problem statement finalized (four contributions)
- [x] Research proposal drafted and shared with mentor via Overleaf; mentor endorsed NeurIPS 2026 Datasets & Benchmarks track
- [x] GitHub repo scaffolded, WandB team created, **repo now public** (Apr 7)
- [x] 5 Kaggle datasets identified, AssetOpsBench forked and reviewed
- [x] Compute confirmed (Insomnia cluster + GCP credits) and compute plan committed (`docs/archive/compute_plan.md`)
- [x] WatsonX API access received from mentor (Apr 5) and verified end-to-end - 6 Llama models available; Llama-4-Maverick-17B and Llama-3.3-70B-instruct benchmarked (`docs/knowledge-base/reference/2026-04-06_watsonx_access.md`)
- [x] Data pipeline + tracked public-safe processed datasets landed (`data/processed/` with synthetic asset metadata, DGA records, failure modes, fault records, RUL labels, and sensor readings - development-ready and safe to publish)
- [x] MCP server skeletons landed for all four domains (IoT, FMSR, TSFM, WO) on a shared base class with substantive domain logic (IEC 60599 Rogers Ratio DGA analysis, RUL forecast, anomaly detection, work-order CRUD)
- [x] `docs/data_pipeline.tex` paper section drafted
- [x] **Mid-point report submitted** (`reports/2026-04-06_midpoint_submission.pdf`) to Courseworks on Mon Apr 6

**Week 2 (landed on canonical history):**
- [x] GitHub Projects reset as the canonical planning surface, with weekly iterations, workstream parent issues, and delivery-gate milestones
- [x] Successful Insomnia A6000 vLLM serve smoke test for Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, with kept smoke-test logs and fixed serve/test scripts
- [x] First real SmartGridBench WandB run is live and back-linked to committed benchmark artifacts
- [x] Plan-Execute is wired to the team’s Smart Grid MCP servers as a real experiment condition, with a successful WatsonX-hosted 70B / Mac 1-scenario smoke proof run under `benchmarks/cell_Y_plan_execute/`
- [x] Scenario realism validation note landed with IEEE / IEC grounded findings for Dhaval-facing review

**Still open from the original W2 critical path / backlog:**
- [ ] `#3` Canonical benchmark scenario proof on the AssetOpsBench stack (Akshat)
- [ ] `#58` Benchmark-Llama-path validation closeout plus `#9-#12` MCP hardening/tests (Tanisha) - PR `#115` now contains a real Insomnia A6000 / self-hosted 8B / all-4-server proof run plus branch-specific long-context serve notes, but the merge/readme cleanup is still open (see `docs/insomnia_runbook.md`)
- [ ] `#7` / `#59` profiling wrappers and the first profiling-linked experiment capture path (Aaron)
- [ ] `#15` / `#17` / `#18` / `#20` scenario-count, judge, and first trajectory artifacts (Akshat)

**Paper-grade scenario corpus:** 36 validated SmartGridBench scenarios — 31 hand-authored + 5 promoted generated. This is the canonical count used for the final NeurIPS and CourseWorks claims (frozen at NeurIPS submission, 2026-05-07).

**Current repo corpus:** 61 scenario files under `data/scenarios/` plus 5 negative validation fixtures. The 25 scenarios beyond the 36 paper-grade canonical were added post-submission via PR #199 (#55 batch A and B) to grow the repo corpus and are deliberately not part of any evaluated/judged claims.

**Resolved during the Apr 16 post-call audit:**
- [x] `#13` WO architecture review closed as a documented keep-vs-pivot decision
- [x] `#28` closed against the first real shared WandB run and its committed benchmark artifacts

**W3 focus (Apr 14-20):**
- Experiment 1 profiling captures plus profiling-to-WandB linkage (`#25`, `#27`)
- Problem Statement B kickoff: Knowledge Plugin, first generation prototype, and evaluation methodology (`#50`, `#2`, `#51`)
- NeurIPS abstract outline and title candidates (`#77`)
- Runbook consolidation for the infra / serve / profiling path (`#37`)

**Committed W3-W5 tracks:**
- Experiment 1: MCP overhead and optimization (Direct vs MCP-baseline vs MCP-optimized)
- Experiment 2: orchestration comparison and failure analysis
- Problem Statement B extension: scenario generation pipeline, Knowledge Plugin, and validation methodology
- NeurIPS 2026 draft first, then back-port to the class IEEE report format

**Current default scope decision:** the working comparison is still **vanilla Agent-as-Tool vs vanilla Plan-Execute**. The repo now also has an active local mitigation stream for PE + Self-Ask and an optional Verified PE third-method prototype, but neither should muddy the honesty of the core AaT vs PE story. The primary local benchmark model remains self-hosted Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct with 70B reserved for selective WatsonX spot-checks.

### AI Use Disclosure

Per the HPML AI Use Policy, Team 13 used AI assistance during this project.

**Tools used:** Claude and Codex.

**Specific purpose:** We used AI tools for brainstorming, debugging support, code navigation, runbook/checklist assistance, and prose polishing. Experimental design decisions, reported measurements, profiling interpretations, quantitative analysis, and final claims were checked by team members against committed code, experiment logs, dashboard records, and exported result artifacts.

**Sections affected:** README/runbook wording, report and presentation polishing, checklist maintenance, and selected implementation/debugging workflows.

**How we verified correctness:** We ran the reported experiments ourselves, preserved result artifacts under `benchmarks/`, `results/`, and `reports/`, cross-checked headline claims against the committed evidence tables, and manually reviewed final public-facing wording before submission.

By submitting this project, the team confirms that the analysis, interpretations, and conclusions are our own, and that AI assistance is disclosed here.
